# The Market Place
Market Place is a game where users can buy from a list of 12 items. The prices for each of the items will be displayed and as the user buys an item, money will be deducted from their account in exchange for one of those items. That item is kept in a player inventory. Additionally, every 15 seconds, the prices of those items will change. The player will also be allowed to 'sell' items from their inventory in exchange for the current price of the item. This will give the player to buy the items at one price, and then sell at another.

Every 15 seconds, the prices change and with it the listed price on the DOM. Specifically, the market price of each of the items fluctuate up or down (positive or negative) fifty cents (between 1 cent and 50 cents) with each fifteen-second interval.

Any given item is not allowed to go below a cost of 50 cents, or above the cost of 9 dollars and 99 cents.

Available to the user is a total cash and an inventory display that shows how much of each of the item they have purchased. Also on the user display, is an average purchased price, which shows, on average, how much money they have spent on a given item in their inventory.

The user starts with $100.
